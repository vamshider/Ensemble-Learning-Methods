# Implementation of Bagging and Boosting methods using Python

* This implementation does not use scikit-learn and is implemented from the scratch.

* This Decision tree used is based on the ID3 algorithm choosing the attribute-value pair using INFORMATION GAIN as the splitting criterion.

* The tree we learn is a BINARY tree, which means that every node has only two branches. 

* The Datasets used are mushroom.train and mushroom.test from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
